With $c=2$ and $r=3$ the time requirement is $\\mathcal O(n^{1.58})$. This is a substantial improvement over $n^2$. To demonstrate the improvement, consider the multiplication of two numbers with $n=1024$ digits. Using the simple verion, with four recursive calls, the multiplication will take about 1,048,576 steps. With Karatsuba's improvement it will require $59,049$ steps."
